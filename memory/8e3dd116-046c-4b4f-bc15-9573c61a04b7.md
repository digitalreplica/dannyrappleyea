# HackerOne Ultimate Challenge
#SharedDigitalMemory

I'm creating the ultimate HackerOne bounty challenge. Find the golden ring. It is the most difficult challenge you will ever face. You may have to compromise dozens of companies to find even a single copy. But it's worth it, believe me, it's worth it.

I will pay $5K to the first hacker that can prove a company violated the license agreement

I have created a public bitbucket repository under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 license. Any organization is free to use the information in the repo, including for profit. But only if they attribute the source, and release any derived data with the same license. Open source.

This is a DATA license. If it included in a database, that means the organization accepted the terms of the license agreement.
