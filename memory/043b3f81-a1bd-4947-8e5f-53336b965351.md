# *Fire* *LLC*

## $1 Company
I want you to own a company. Enough that I will pay you $1 to do it. And perhaps $1 is all it takes to get one.

This is my experiment. A FIRE LLC.

I believe in the FIRE movement, that one can save enough money to live off the growth. I'm saving. Not there, but on the way. Then the thought.

Can you create a FIRE LLC?

I've been obsessed with the concept of a cheap company. Stripping away nearly everything until you have the minimum needed to become profitable. That number hovers around $500 per year. Far less than I need to survive on.

The Fire premise is saving enough to live off the interest and growth of your investments. The often quote goal is 4%. That's really earning 7% and losing 3% to inflation.

An LLC with the goal of becoming profitable at all costs can lower that considerably. Say, earning 3%, and ignoring inflation for a few years.

That's $16,666.67 needed to try this. Maybe more or less depending on how this shaky pandemic economy shakes out. Who knows.

But that money is within reach. Within anyone's reach.

# Financial plan
* Maintain an LLC at ~$500/year in expenses.
* Earn $500/year from investments
* Earn $501/year from patronage
* Spend $500/year in patronage.
* Claim $1 in profit.

# Why?
Without diving too deep into tax law, income solely from investments is considered by the IRS to be either passive or portfolio income, not the active income it's looking for. But we live in a world of patronage, which certainly counts as active income.

With active income greater than investment, even the IRS can't argue that it's a legitimate LLC.

# Multiply by 1000
One person doing this is interesting. But I really want to see what happens when a thousand people do it.

This thousand would have to fund their own investment portion. Can't help there.

But the patronage becomes interesting math. Only $1,500 is needed to make 1000 people profitable.

Person 1's LLC:
* Covers expenses from investment income.
* Earns $501 from patronage
* Keeps $1 in profit
* Spends $500 in patronage to Person 2
* Add $1 of personal money to raise back to $501

Repeat 1000 times. Or even a million times. After the first $500 is pushed into the system, it only costs each person $1 to keep it going.

# Precedents
* Investing clubs
* Wealthy families (Walmart)

# Complications
* Is this now an investment firm, subject to SEC regulation?
