Exploring the freedom of the body. Muscle and bone and gravity.

# Hands and Knees Spinal Wheel
Hand and knees, spine straight. Focus on the tailbone. Let the spine sink, letting it drape from pelvis to shoulder like a suspension bridge. Let your attention fall with them, into the valley, then rolling uphill to the shoulders. Then shoulders roll up as the spine lifts, attention following an arc into the air peaking mid spine. Then it curves and races down to the tailbone again.

It's like a giant ball bearing is using your spine to draw a circle. Tailbone, spine low, shoulders, spine high. Turning round and round.
