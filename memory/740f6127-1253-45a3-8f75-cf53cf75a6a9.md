# *Projects* Solar Charging Laptop

Is is practical to charge phones and laptops using only solar power?

So far: takes a bit more effort than plugging in, but totally doable.

# Gear
## Panel
[Amazon.com: BigBlue 100W Portable Solar Panels Kit with PD Type C](https://www.amazon.com/BigBlue-Portable-Charging-Charger-Station/dp/B083NS75XH)
* 100W solar panel
* 45W PD usb-c
* kickstand for better positioning
* DC Output Voltage: 12-18V/5.5AMax

## Power Station
https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Portable-PowerHouse-Generator-Emergency/dp/B0899GZ3WR
* 300W AC, 60W USB-C
* built-in Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) controller
* can recharge solar at 65W, but Anker recommends 100W panel
* Use a solar charger with a 7.9 mm x 0.9 mm DC port.
* Rated Capacity: 27,000mAh 14.4V/388.8Wh (Cell Capacity: 108,000mAh)
* Input: 11-28V 5.5A (65W Max)

# Impressions
## Charging
On a sunny day, getting 50-75% charge on the power station. Could probably improve that by moving the panel more during the day to catch the sun. Still plenty to completely charge a laptop and phone. On cloudy days, it's barely worth putting the panel out.

On average, there's enough sun to charge the power station and several phone-sized batteries pretty much continuously.

## Practicality
Really taking advantage means setting everything up every day, maybe moving the panel to catch morning and afternoon sun, and checking power levels to swap batteries when needed.

I do worry about someone stealing it, but not overly much.

## Panel
Overall a great panel. Very portable. The kickstands are rather flimsy, but work well to angle it. Getting great power from it.

The panel by itself can't really be used to charge a laptop. 45W USB-C is under perfect conditions in full sun. Really getting about 20W, which is super low, and the power fluctuates too much. Seems perfect to charge the power station. MPPT pretty critical to handle the fluctuating voltages.

The charging cord between panel and power station is short, maybe 18". Need a longer one.

## Power station
Awesome, but a bit heavy to lug around. USB-C outputs 60W, and charges a laptop pretty easily. Can also charge an ipad (or phone) at the same time. Rated to recharge a laptop five times, seems like that's pretty close to reality.

# Notes
* DC voltage 22.1V on panel
* Phone shows charging via USB
* Battery pack shows charging via USB
* Macbook shows charging at 24W via USB-C
