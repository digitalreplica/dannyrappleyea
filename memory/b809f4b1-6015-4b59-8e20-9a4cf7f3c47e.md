# Shared Digital Memory
#SharedDigitalMemory

This is an open, work-in-progress knowledge system to organize not only what you know, but also what others know, and weave them together into a cohesive whole.

# Basic Terminology
## Memory Repository
This is where you keep your links, notes, snippets, and writings. It's an indexible collection of knowledge.

## Page
A note or document.

## Tag
A hashtag for a page. [How to use hashtags](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/how-to-use-hashtags)

## Concept
The union of one or more tags defining a single mental concept.

### Index

# Basic Premise
You create pages, tied to a single concept. Always start with the concept, in the fewest words you can. Consider the tags in this page.

#favorite #food

You could have a single page titled, "All my favorite food." You could have many pages like "Pizza" and "Poke" going into great detail about the variety you like, or your favorite places to get them.

And from this point forward, you just have to think *favorite food*, and you know exactly how to find this information.

## Mental connections
The more often you follow this practice, the easier it becomes.

You find a new food that you like. So you follow the train of thought *favorite food* into your memory repo, finding your pages on it there. You open one you've already made, or create a new one, and add your new favorite food.

You've started down the path of a new mental connection. The more often you repeat it, the stronger the pathway to it. You're both:

* Training your brain how to find things in your knowledge system.
* Training your knowledge system to think like your brain.

The knowledge becomes literally a digital extension of your thinking process, utterly unique to you.

## Harder than it looks
I started playing with this concept by bringing in a bunch of old notes that I've tagged the crap out of. Think that's a downside to Evernote and similar apps, keep piling stuff in, throw a bunch of tags at it, and hope like crazy you'll be able to find it later.

I needed to Marie Kondo my tagging. Yup, asking if that tag brings me joy. Or more precisely, *Is that the way I actually think about it and remember it?*

What's truly important is the concept. A tag is a stepping stone to the concept. Utterly and literally the path your brain takes to think about it. Threads of memory. *favorite food*

And you really have to think about your concepts for this to work. What about a page titled "Food" with the tag `#favorite`.

# Knowledge should accumulate
It doesn't really matter where you start with this system. A pasted link, a quick jot. The trick is be able to capture it within a few seconds. Click, click, paste, scribble, done.

The easier it becomes to capture something, the more you'll capture, until it becomes something you do instinctively, not really spending any mental energy on the process.

## Accumulate, then expand
Favor large pages that thoroughly cover a concept. Within a page, it's up to you to deal with the content. This can be a braindump of links you found interesting, to a well organized page with sections for each subtopic.

A good memory repo should have a mixture of both. The stuff you really care about gets cultivated and pretty. Everything else, well, meh.

Only when that page is just too big, should you think about splitting. And by then, you pretty much know how you're gonna split it anyway.

So that page might split into several, all with the same concept. Favorite foods, favorite places.

At that point your very concept has grown. It needs multiple tags, because it's the intersection of two different concepts. *favorite recipes*. You have a whole bunch of recipe pages. You have a whole bunch of favorite thing pages. But *favorite recipes* is a distinct concept all on it's own.

Version 1.0

This is a way of recording your thoughts, and sharing them with your friends. But unlike all the other apps you use, this app is something that you create, and control. Social media the way it is supposed to be.

How it works
There is a place for podcasts, and videos. But then, there is a place for the written word. This is that place. Based on a premise that I believe.

> Information wants to be free.

This is my guide to doing that, and perhaps making money along the way.

Guide.
Make one commit a day. Organize it. Make it easy to find and index everything.

Turn it loose on the world. Taint data so badly with license encumberences, that unscupulous corporations will one day be breached. And all your data exposed to the world. If you've used our data against our license agreements, we will sue.

This is a fight for content. Data is the new gold. Charge dearly for yours.

## Readme
This is your memory repository. It's a text focused interface. A way of organizing a world full of so many complex things. It's a knowledge system, a way of retrieving most anything you know about your own life. Cause we've seen, our memories are pretty frail.

Instructions
Create a git-based repo

--
### Intro
Imagine.

A global, shared digital memory.

All the knowledge you know, multiplied by every being on earth.

At your fingertips, you can know what the world knows. And vice versa.

Knowledge nodes
A single concept. Labeled with multiple tags in each language. Singular or plural. Title is the sorted tags.

Sorted by date, or number of times edited.

Memory node. A single self-contained knowledge system.
Knowledge node. Contains no memories, but is a summation of multiple memory nodes. Might be a single person looking across all of their memory nodes. Focused on breadth of knowledge.
Knowledge hub. Focused on a single topic.

Curation: Who creates the repo? Human or Computed?

How do we dynamically discover memory and knowledge nodes?

Knowledge nodes:
Import file: list of memory nodes to import. Can be
* an entire memory repo
* a specific topic in that memory repo
* a specific note in that memory repo
* all repos with a specific topic


### Support Me
* If you found this repo useful, consider donating a dollar.

## The Evil Twist
The license for this repo is anathema to businesses. It basically says that if they use this data, they must release their resulting data (their private databases) using the same license. No company making money off user data will want that.

### Legal Case
This repo has value. We can show this, because we get revenue from it. It is properly licensed for use in only certain ways. This company Evil_Company_X has used my data in violation of the license agreement clearly stated with the data set.

Why?
It's my way of fighting businesses too.

# Single Memory Algorithm
## Markdown links
Same as symlink
* create an entry point under threads, one markdown file for each tag, named with the tag name.
* create multitags in .threads, named with the sha256 hash of the tags (with '#'?)
* link with relative links in markdown

# Design
* Memory files must have an immutable name. Titles and tags can change at will
* Tags: singular or plural? [Tags as API reference?]() API design seems to say plural. Twitter?
* Title memory: Title and tags match

## Finding memories
Indexing and finding memories quickly is the highest priority. Back to hard drive days, we're trying to minimize seek time to find information.

### Using a single tag
All memories should theoretically be accessible using a single tag. For simple repositories, this should be true. But the more that's added, a single tag might index hundreds of memories.

General approaches
* Highlight title memory, where the title and tags exactly match, indicating that this is the starting page for this concept
* Highlight recent pages, on the assumption that you will want to continue works in progress.
* Highlight edited pages. The more revisions a memory has, the more important it is to you.
* Show refining tags. These narrow down the index for large concepts.
  * Highlight "large" concepts with many pages under it. (Should pages with many changes count as 1, or the number of commits?)
  * Highlight recent concepts.
* Show remaining pages? If there are hundreds of pages, show all of them? Show top N pages?

### Using multiple tags
Using more than one tag finds all concepts that have all selected tags

# Usage
* Create a concept
  * In the memory folder, create a file named <guid>.md [What's a guid?]()
  * The first line should be `# Title`. Hash symbol, one space, and anything else you want to describe this concepts
  * The second line should the the tags that make up the concept, like `#tag1 #tag2`. Each tag starts with a hash symbol, and ends with a space or end-of-line. Multiple tags are delimited by spaces.
* Link to other concepts.
  * In this repo, use a relative link, like [Shared Digital Memory](./b809f4b1-6015-4b59-8e20-9a4cf7f3c47e.md)
  * In another repo or web page, use an absolute url.
* Index concepts. Run the algorithm of your choice.

# Sharing and multi-repo indexing
A single memory repo is intended to be a self-contained body of knowledge. But the true power is linking multiple memory repos together to make a much larger knowledge base.

# Questions
Should the index for a given repo live in the repo?

## Marie Kondo'ing My Tags
Started with 74 tags. Ended with 14. Not sure if that's the right amount, but seems much more manageable.
