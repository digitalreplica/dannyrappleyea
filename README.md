# Shared Digital Memory Project

This is an individual [Shared Digital Memory](./memory/b809f4b1-6015-4b59-8e20-9a4cf7f3c47e.md) repository. 

## The Basic Concepts
You create one (or more) git-based "memory" repositories. You fill it with notes, things you've learned, stuff you want to keep. You organize it all with multiple tags in a way that creates threads of memory hints to help you find it later.

You can keep a memory repository total private, share it with a few friends, or open it to the whole world.

## Getting Started
* Fork repo (or create your own.)

## Rules
* Never rename a memory file, because it will break anything linked to it
