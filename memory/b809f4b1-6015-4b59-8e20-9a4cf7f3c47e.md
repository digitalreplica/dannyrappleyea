Version 1.0

This is a way of recording your thoughts, and sharing them with your friends. But unlike all the other apps you use, this app is something that you create, and control. Social media the way it is supposed to be.

How it works
There is a place for podcasts, and videos. But then, there is a place for the written word. This is that place. Based on a premise that I believe.

> Information wants to be free.

This is my guide to doing that, and perhaps making money along the way.

Guide.
Make one commit a day. Organize it. Make it easy to find and index everything.

Turn it loose on the world. Taint data so badly with license encumberences, that unscupulous corporations will one day be breached. And all your data exposed to the world. If you've used our data against our license agreements, we will sue.

This is a fight for content. Data is the new gold. Charge dearly for yours.

## Readme
This is your memory repository. It's a text focused interface. A way of organizing a world full of so many complex things. It's a knowledge system, a way of retrieving most anything you know about your own life. Cause we've seen, our memories are pretty frail.

Instructions
Create a git-based repo

## The Evil Twist
The license for this repo is anathema to businesses. It basically says that if they use this data, they must release their resulting data (their private databases) using the same license. No company making money off user data will want that.

### Legal Case
This repo has value. We can show this, because we get revenue from it. It is properly licensed for use in only certain ways. This company Evil_Company_X has used my data in violation of the license agreement clearly stated with the data set.

Why?
It's my way of fighting businesses too.
