# Individual *LLC*

Businesses are far more tax efficient than an individual person. Why? It's fairly simple. Businesses can deduct all their expenses and only pay taxes on the remainder. Individuals get a few select deductions, then pay taxes, then use the remainder to pay expenses.

An Individual LLC takes advantage of this to funnel as much individual income as possible through a single-member LLC. Patreon and the gig economy show that creative ways to earn money are out there. This is incentive to find more of those.
