# *Interests* Meditation

Meditation
* trying to perceive the workings of the brain.
* breathing without any muscular tension, so breath is free in the chest
* sometimes letting body movement breathe for you

## The art of paying attention
We have mostly the illusion of consciousness. Thoughts flicker through untold regurgitations of the past. But we can only focus on on at a time. So our brain flits from one thing to another. Thought, sensation in the body, more thought. Slow down thoughts enough, and this becomes apparent. Seeing your "mind" bouncing from sensation to memory and back.

But sometimes we let memory get too strong. Especially today. For most of all, our minds pick out the one thing that speaks *Fear*. And we want it to. Because there are plenty of things to fear in this world.

When that happens, it's sensation you need to pay attention to. Focus on the present, on breathing, what's happening to your body right now. Grounding, perhaps is a good word.

Consciousness
* all the voices in our our heads, speaking at once
* every remembered perception
