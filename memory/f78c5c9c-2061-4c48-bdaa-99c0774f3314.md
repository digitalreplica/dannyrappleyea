# *Interests* Meditation

Meditation
* trying to perceive the workings of the brain.
* breathing without any muscular tension, so breath is free in the chest
* sometimes letting body movement breathe for you

Consciousness
* all the voices in our our heads, speaking at once
* every remembered perception
