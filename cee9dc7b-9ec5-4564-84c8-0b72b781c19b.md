# *Interests* Aerial Silks and Sling

# Aerial Sling
Sling seems like a halfway point between aerial yoga and aerial silks. It's not as intensely aerobic as silks, with a mixture of moves from both silks and yoga. Still quite a good core workout, and getting into some intense stretches.

## Moves learned
* Straddle back. Sitting in sling, legs wide, leaning back until you turn upside down. Can hook the feet around the poles and hands either lifted, or on the floor for a kind of headstand or handstand.
* King pigeon. Lean back like straddle back, but hook one leg on the pole at the knee. Other leg goes straight, then bends down. Arms curve towards it to catch it in an upside down backbend.
* Roll up. Stand on sling with one foot, other slightly behind, holding pole at the same shoulder as the sling foot with both hands. Then link silks candy cane rollup.
