# *Interests* Solar
I'd really like to power my house with solar one day. Until then, I'll experiment with solar in smaller ways.

* Want to power my electric bike with solar

# Short-term goals
* Experiment with solar panels and a small power bank.
* Try to power laptops and phone from solar
* Learn about power conversions and storage

# Long-term goals
* House power is energy neutral

## Questions
* Can bike battery be used?

* What would it take to power my house?

## Terminology

### Measuring battery capacity
* Typically watt-hours (Wh), kilowatt-hours (kWh), or ampere-hours (Ahr)
* Converting Ahr: multiply Ahr by average voltage

### Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT)
Solar panels put out a wide range of voltage depending on sun and temperature. Charging a battery needs a much smaller range. MPPT does a smart DC->DC conversion to get the optimal voltage for charging.
