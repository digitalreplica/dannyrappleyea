# Corporate Data Starvation
#corporate #license

I've always lived by the premise of giving corporations minimal information. I'm on Facebook, but mostly for the annual happy birthday wishes. I want to go beyond that though, to actively starving corporations of their most valuable resource.

My data.

However, the sharing that the Internet brings has helped me beyond measure. I feel an obligation to give back.

This is my experiment to find the balance between those two pillars.

## Social media without social media
I want all the benefits that social media brings without giving corporations an easy way to monitize it. That means ripping up and rejecting almost everything hurled at us.

So I'm trying to recreate all of it. With no compromises. Posting updates, having followers, a wide reach out into the world.

Or rather, I'm trying to repurpose what's already there to do the same sorts of things. On my terms.

## Licenses
At the very heart of the issue is personal data, and the license by which it is used. Greedy corporations say "By using our service, we can monitize your data however we see fit, and don't have to tell you all the ways we sell it."

So I start with the license. Specifically the [Creative Commons — Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International  — CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/). It is the best license I've found to accomplish my goals. Specifically:

Encourage personal use. This is one of the Creative Common's [Free Culture Licenses](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/freeworks), allowing for broad use and reuse.

Discourage corporate use. The ShareAlike clause means that if a corporation runs the data through their algorithm, creating a derived work, they must give that derived work the same license. I would dearly love to see that happen, force them to release their secret databases under an open license.

## How you can help
Easy. Do the same thing. Share your data under a license of your choosing.

I don't care which license either. In some ways, more types of licenses is better. Make companies work extra hard to filter all the data flowing into their systems to make sure it's not encumbered with a license they can't stomach.
