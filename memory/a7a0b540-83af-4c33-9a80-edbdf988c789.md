## [*SharedDigitalMemory*](): The Art of Open Source, Individual LLC Living

I don't really like the state of human society. Individuals have very little power compared to corporations and governments. I'm a hacker, so this is my experiment hacking the societal structures directly, trying to sway the balance over to the individual.

My weapon of choice. [*IndividualLLC*](). Code execution inside law itself.

# Premise
Corporations are merely legal structures of (usually) groups of people, backed by governments, intended to make money. But an individual can own one.

So why not?

Let's do it.

# Castle defending against the Corporate Siege
I like bitcoin, but it's premise is the storage of currency. But information is the new currency, with the potential for infinite growth.

Corporate lifeblood and value is based not so much on what it does, but the dataset it owns. And there are only two types of data: [people, things]. Of the two, people data is the more valuable.

And I happen to own a people data.

So I declare that all information about me as a person is the intellectual property of my LLC. And I will sue any company that tries to steal it. On the flip side, I might license it to corporations at very reasonable rates.

# Fire
The Fire movement is partially about money, but it's more about "the freedom to do whatever the hell I want."

# Winning
How I will know if I've won? What my success criteria?

## Goal 1 - Profit
My LLC must be profitable.

## Goal 2 - Patronage
Some income must come from patronage.

## Goal 3 - Pay more expenses
LLC has enough money to pay for more of its own expenses. Phone, email, domains.

## Goal 4 - Pay individuals
My LLC dedicates a portion of income for individual patronage. I will bootstrap others. 25% of profit will be allocated to reward other individuals for their work.

## Goal 5 - License income
A corporation pays me for some of my data.

## Goal 6 - Fund retirement
An individual LLC can fund it's own 401k, right? That sounds like fun.

## Goal 7 - Buy a Tesla
Why yes, I would like my LLC to buy a Tesla for my personal use. Because...why not?

## Goal 8 - Personal Fire
My ultimate goal is an LLC that pays for all my expenses. Then I will truly have the freedom to think and do the things I want.
