# *Digital* *Human* *Memory* Git and Markdown Notes System

## About
A notes system using git and markdown, and an ever evolving organization system.

# Fundamentals
* Notes are markdown files
* Densely linked
* In a flat structure
* With filenames that never change
* Stored in a git repo

# HowTo
* Create a git repository
* In the root directory, create notes using the naming convention {guid}.md, where {guid} is a random guid.
* Link notes together using markdown relative links [Title](.{guid}.md)
* View your notes through any web browser.

## Goals
* Find any tidbit of knowledge within a reasonable amount of time
* Link related items together
* Plain text
* A process, not a tool
* Must be intuitive
* span multiple repos, public and private



# Methodology
* Flat directory structure: easy linking
* Guid-name.md: permalinks
* Build structure through tags
* Preprosessor builds: scans files and creates index (build job, like jekyll?)
* Static website easy to browse. Local server.
* Start file with `# title`

# Features
* top 10 most recent entries
* Atom plugin: create file named with guid
* Once a month (year?): auto-PR current to master
* Top tags by count
* Untagged files

## Private links
You can link to your private repos safely, but guid.

## Tags
Tags are breadcrumbs. Go from largest to most specific.
#website #github
#software #github

Read all the tags from each file.
Mind map it. Start outward from the root
Symlinks?

# Knowledge Sharing
from repo import #tag
* meta repos
* public or private
* Gather's all tags

For each repo file
* each line is an import
* one or more tags
* one tag: import all memories with that tag
* multiple tags: import all memories with every tag.

Publish knowledge
* create import files that people can copy.



# Repo names
* memory:

# Local server
* Scans all repos for knowledge repos
* Local and remote repos

# Rollover
* annual rollover. Can pick date: new years, birthday, other special day. PR current to master, squash commits

# Rules
* All notes are github-flavored markdown.
* Link notes using relative links, using markdown links like ```[link text](paste file path here.md)```

## Organizing
Topics - keyword that your mind uses to group ideas together
Structure - Meta-notes tying topics together. Using READMEs?
