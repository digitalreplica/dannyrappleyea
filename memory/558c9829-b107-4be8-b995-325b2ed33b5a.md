# *Interests* Yoga

Exploring the freedom of the body. Muscle and bone, gravity and time.

# Breath
Always breathe up.

# Practices
## Two Blocks
Take two sturdy yoga blocks, cork works well. Place them wider than shoulder width on a carpet. Stand on them. The carpet should let them move a little, up and down. Press evenly straight down from each foot.
* Squat. Come back up.
* On each breath, sweep fingertips up to the sky.
* Shift from tree on block, to tree on the other block.

# Hands and Knees Spinal Wheel
Hand and knees, spine straight. Focus on the tailbone. Let the spine sink, letting it drape from pelvis to shoulder like a suspension bridge. Let your attention fall with them, into the valley, then rolling uphill to the shoulders. Then shoulders roll up as the spine lifts, attention following an arc into the air peaking mid spine. Then it curves and races down to the tailbone again.

It's like a giant ball bearing is using your spine to draw a circle. Tailbone, spine low, shoulders, spine high. Turning round and round.
