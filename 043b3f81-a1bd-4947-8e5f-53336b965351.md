# *Fire* *LLC*

Long post. TLDR: Using FIRE principals to fund a micro LLC expenses.

The FIRE movement has a simple tenant, to live off your investment income. I'm working towards it, but not there yet. I'm most interested in the transition point. What happens when you stop saving, and need to start spending? Is that a different mix of investments, and what would that look like?

I could read more, or do simulations. But I'd rather get my hands dirty, and learn by doing. Preferably on a much smaller scale that I can do **right now**.

A LLC.

I started a company to write, and play with ideas. It's a single-member LLC, which is the smallest (and least expensive) legally-separate corporate structure. It's running on the minimum possible expenses to keep it functioning. My budget for all expenses is under $500 per year. Using the 4% rule, I'd hit FIRE at $12,500.

Seems perfect for experimenting, right? At this scale, there's a lot of freedom to play with investment mixes, perhaps several of them. Failure won't mean I'm eating ramen cups instead of steak. Even a massive 10% or 20% loss means I'm only down $50 to $100. But it's real money in real investments, so a great opportunity to learn in a fairly safe way.

Now, what's the optimal FIRE strategy to achieve this? I have ideas, and am looking for feedback and advice.

It seems like the fundamental difference in transitioning from saving to spending is the need for cash flow with smaller investment horizons. The Bogleheads 3-fund portfolio fails for short term needs, so I need a financial bridge to cover the gap. That leaps into dividend investing and other areas I'm not very familiar with (but have been reading like crazy.) Income-focused strategies I found include:

* Bonds
* ETFs that favor dividends
* Real estate ETFs
* Savings, CDs, and other money equivilents

The realistic returns I'm seeing range from 2.5% to 4.5%, meaning an investment pool between $11,111 and $20,000. The first $12,500 estimate still seems possible, so that's my initial stake.

I'm focusing primarily on dividend ETFs, but so far are finding them quite confusing. It seems like there's dozens of indexes with large swaths of overlap. I still want as broad a diversification as I can get, while  keeping decent returns. So here's my short list of ETFs (and the index they track).

The TD Ameritrade Income Estimator estimates $535 in potential income, using a bit of weighting towards higher performing ETFs. Is this the best mix? Probably not, but I think I'm on the right track.

Now the questions...

I have no idea yet how this breaks down in terms of large vs small cap, US vs global, different sectors, etc. Anyone know a good tool to calculate this before buying?

I've only bought mutual funds so far. ETFs are a whole new world with far more price fluctuations. Any advice on how to buy low?

I think with this, I have a more complete FIRE picture. Still 6-12 months of cash for downturns and immediate needs, this short-horizon investing to cover the next year or so, then more traditional index funds for anything above that for long-term growth.

Anything I'm missing?

Thanks in advance for the read, and any replies.

I'm estimating a realistic return in the 3-5%. That means an investment pool of $10,000 to $16,667.

Since it's already part way through the year, it's likely way more if I want to make it this year. But it should set me up for a good start next year.

# Income
## Cofi
Like me? Give me a one-time $1 Cofi.

Support me long term. $1/month, or more.
* $1/mo:  Big thumbs up
* $10/mo: ?

# FIRE
I've completely ignored inflation because of the short timelines. But what about adding those in? The common FIRE percentage I see is 3%. Since it's a longer timeline, stocks seem entirely reasonably. Typical returns there are 6-8%.

3% of $500 is a measly $15. At 6% to 8% returns, that's only an additional $188 to $250. Seems like growth stocks would work well, buying to hold longer term, basically deferring the income until later when I need it.

# Fat FIRE
Now when it truly gets interesting. Income for expenses is pretty much guaranteed, and there's more money coming in to play with. What if all of that were reinvested, to catch the exponential growth curve?

Strategies: Low amounts of riskier investments. Emerging markets, bitcoin.
